This is my first blog post on my new academic website! I'm excited to share my learning journey, research experiences, and thoughts on financial mathematics and data science.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I plan to write about:

1. **Research Notes** - Summaries and insights from my research projects
2. **Learning Resources** - Useful materials I discover during my studies
3. **Technical Tutorials** - Code snippets and explanations for financial modeling
4. **Conference/Workshop Reviews** - Experiences from academic events

## Current Focus

I'm currently working on:
- High-Dimensional Statistics
- Mathematical modelling in the real financial application

Stay tuned for more posts!
